# Naming & Coding Convention
This study attempts to define coding rules before studying the basics.
The reason for defining the coding rule is as follows.
The close relationship with design, browser, script, performance, and accessibility makes it easy to work quickly and easily in any browser.
Coding conventions define the standards that developers adhere to to meet these conditions.
Learn from studies to see if unified code can play a decisive role in improving business efficiency.
Adhering to coding conventions also makes it easier to share code among project members and to create consistent code.
It is important to write source code on a unified basis.

# Naming Rule
A. General Rules
Names should be written in lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
B. Start Name
The name can only start with a lowercase letter.
Note that the comment sentence accepts English capital letters. (E.g. / * AIDAT UI Love and ZeroCho 2020_486 * /)

(ex. 2019chanmin(x) - > chanmin2019(o), _chanmin(x) -> chanmin(o), Chanmin(x) -> chanmin(o))

C. Lowercase letters, numbers, and underscore combinations
• Only lowercase letters, numbers and underscores (_) can be used.
• Underscores (_) are used only for words and word combinations.
• Promised words with underscores (_) can be used in combination with numbers and lowercase letters.
